		<h3 class="title">Coffee Cake</h3> 
		<p>Day 27: Cake</p>
		<p>I didn&apos;t want to do another cute pink cake. I love their look, but I wasn&apos;t in the mood for cute. I was in the mood for coffee. The saucer and its reflection were hard. There are many changes to the surface that hit the light in different ways. I am not sure how I would do that.</p>
