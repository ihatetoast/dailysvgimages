		<p>Day 30: Food of Choice</p>
		<p>There is a food truck near me that makes amazing burgers. They've spoiled me for others. I knew that today I was going to have a burger, so deciding which food of choice was easy. the hard part was how to show my love for them. I was going to hug it, but I liked how this turned out. I forgot to do her other arm, but I think the way she's sitting, I would not need her arm anyway. </p>
