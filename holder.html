		<p>Day 17: Guitar Hero ...thingy </p>
		<p>I've never played, so I have no idea what they call this. I just looked at the image given and went for it. Kept it really simple since I started at 10p. Not sure I found the love in this. Making the places where the gaps are subtracted out have soft edges was hard. There are ugly edges, but hey &mdash; it is late.</p>
